I... I wanted to introduce myself.

00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:36,787
Oh, I'm... I'm not sure
you're supposed to smoke here?

4
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:44,169
OK.

5
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,925
You're an awesome player
to watch.

00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:51,927
Yes.

7
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,401
Anyways, I... I should go.
They're --

8
00:01:10,426 --> 00:01:11,655
waiting for me.
But, um...

9
00:01:11,868 --> 00:01:13,240
good luck
in the tournament.

10
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:23,667
You will not be so nice
when we beat you.

That's not happening.

12

Flash me those numbers.

Number three's excited.

Yeah, that's better!
Alright.

I can't tell you how excited
Montréalers are about this.

We don't care
he came number two.

59
00:03:35,794 --> 00:03:38,301
People are popping champagne
all over Québec.

60
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:39,829
Oh, and, uh,

61
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:40,721
just to be clear,

62
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,644
uh, we are thrilled

63
00:03:42,668 --> 00:03:45,158
that Shane is Asian,
or Asian-Canadian.

64
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,143
Very thrilled.

65
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,186
I mean, we've historically
broken barriers,

66
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:49,527
and we're doing it again,
so --

67
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:50,929
nothing to worry about there.

68
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,607
You certainly have.

69
00:03:53,378 --> 00:03:54,331
And, I mean,
to be a part of

70
00:03:54,356 --> 00:03:56,628
the most legendary franchise
in hockey, right?

71
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,571
Oh, my!

72
00:03:58,303 --> 00:03:58,823
It's, uh...

73
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,605
I'm still in shock,

74
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:00,865
but, uh, I...

75
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,033
I'm so excited.

76
00:04:03,258 --> 00:04:05,527
A-And I know this came up
in Shane's interview,

77
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,681
but I am the world's
biggest Metros fan.

78
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,097
Really?

79
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,267
It's part of how
I came to feel Canadian.

80
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:13,795
My dad would sit us down in
the living room, Saturday nights...

81
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,928
We're not passing
on a kid this strong,
with those hands,

82
00:04:19,953 --> 00:04:21,511
not in Boston,
Mr. Rozanov.

83
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,513
He's a very natural
number one pick.

84
00:04:23,738 --> 00:04:25,098
Congratulations again, Ilya.

85
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:26,686
He is strong,

86
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,185
but he needs discipline.

87
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,189
He can be, how you say,

88
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:31,605
lazy.

89
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,650
I find that hard to believe,
the way he plays!

90
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,403
I promise to work
very hard for you.

91
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:40,322
I have no doubt you will, son.

Yeah, totally.

98
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:32,911
Mmm.

99
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,997
It's everything you dreamed of?

100
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,540
Almost.

101
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,003
I'm sorry.

102

No, you're not.

00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,840
Montréal is...

104
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:51,675
It's nice, yes?

105
00:07:51,795 --> 00:07:53,098
Yeah, it's awesome.

106
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:56,685
Boston is nice, too?

107
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,770
I think so.

108
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,730
People like it there.

109
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:03,817
We will, uh...

110
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,361
we will be
seeing each other a lot.

111
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:10,240
Yeah, Boston and...

112
00:08:10,772 --> 00:08:12,575
Montréal play against
each other often.

113
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:54,701
More...

114
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:13,678

You look pretty.

166
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,615
You're wearing makeup, too.

167
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,300
Yeah, but I don't look pretty.

168
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,745
Great. Can we do it again?

169
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:43,217
Can you guys try to hit
those marks at the same time?

170
00:11:43,242 --> 00:11:43,991
That would be good.

171
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:44,746
Just skate out --

172
00:11:45,311 --> 00:11:47,439
and show me
a lot of intensity, alright?

173
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:48,019
OK.

174
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:48,750
Action!

175
00:11:52,423 --> 00:11:54,255
Good. OK, let's do that
one more time.

176
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,051
Great. OK, one more time.

177
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,887
Great. OK!

178
00:12:00,912 --> 00:12:02,428
Guys, just hold there
for a second.

179
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,741
We're gonna make a little tweak
over here with the camera.

180
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,351
I'll let you know when
we're ready to go.

181
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:08,937
In 3, 2, 1, and go ahead.

182
00:12:10,866 --> 00:12:11,261
OK.

183
00:12:11,673 --> 00:12:12,335
I get it, guys.

184
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,499
It's been a long day. I know.

185
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,023
Sorry.

186
00:12:14,048 --> 00:12:15,543
Try with a lot
of intensity, though.

187
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:15,956
OK?

188
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,527
OK.

189
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,633
OK. One more time, guys.

190
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,701
The more serious we can do,
the quicker we go home. Go.

191
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,623
- Go ahead.

192
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:27,180
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:28,331
OK.

194
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:30,961
Oh, I-I can do it.
I promise.

195
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,378
And three, two, one, go ahead.

196
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,773
OK.

197
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,692
OK, I think we have what
we are gonna get here.

198
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,510
Thanks, guys!

199
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,054
When they tell you
you do commercial with me

200
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,221
and not just alone?

201
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,724
I don't know,
like, uh, two days ago?

202
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:51,479
Why? When did they tell you?

203
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:52,960
No, they told me nothing.

204
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,194
It was my idea.

205
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:58,361
Shane!

206
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,798
Shane, are you listening to me?

207
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:03,341
What? Yeah.

208
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,076
OK, so what did I just say?

209
00:13:05,206 --> 00:13:06,302
Sneakers, I heard.

210
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,194
OK, you <i>have</i> to be seen
in your Reeboks.

211
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:08,864
I know, Mom.

212
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,802
Because you <i>cannot</i>
be in anything else.

213
00:13:10,827 --> 00:13:12,183
Mom, I'm always wearing skates.

214
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:13,810
But in case you're not.

215
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,728
This is a lot of money, Shane.

216
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,021
You're the youngest
hockey player

217
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,439
they've ever signed to a deal.

218
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,276
And -- remember
what else this means.

219
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,218
I remember.

220
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:24,554
A whole lot of kids are
gonna be looking up to you,

221
00:13:24,654 --> 00:13:27,265
kids that don't
see themselves here a lot.

222
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,474
I get it, Mom.

223
00:14:20,934 --> 00:14:21,819
Fuck off.

224
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:55,019
Not here.

225
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,223
So, uh,

226
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:05,363
look...

227
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:08,074
we can forget
that happened in there, OK?

228
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:12,662
Is what you want?

229
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:14,539
Yeah, for sure.

230
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,711
Oh, wow.
You are a really bad liar.

231
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:33,474
What is your room number?

232
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:40,106
1410.

233
00:15:42,506 --> 00:15:46,446
Well, if I come
to 1410 tonight at 9:00...

234
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:49,282
I might open.

235
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,685
I might knock.

236
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,719
What are you doing, dude?

237
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,776
No, stop it.
Just stop it.

238
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,343
Oh, hello there.

239
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,404
Oh, I'm trying to go down.

240
00:16:53,543 --> 00:16:54,937
Uh, this is going up.

241
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:55,582
Right.

242
00:16:55,606 --> 00:16:56,307
So...

243
00:16:56,646 --> 00:16:57,558
Yeah, OK.

244
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,585
Well, I'm...
Ah!

245
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:21,707
I thought you might chicken out.

246
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:22,643
I'm not.

247
00:17:22,834 --> 00:17:24,168
I'm not a chicken.

248
00:17:25,535 --> 00:17:27,421
But I think we should--
talk.

249
00:17:29,902 --> 00:17:30,591
Do you...

250
00:17:31,419 --> 00:17:32,109
... wanna sit?

251
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,006
Mmm,

252
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,554
not really.

253
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,416
This is such a bad idea.

254
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,127
What is?

255
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,899
Fuck, Hollander...

256
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,495
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

257
00:19:06,894 --> 00:19:08,022
Was that bad?

258
00:19:08,257 --> 00:19:10,066
Ah, no, opposite.

259
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,526
Is too much, too good.

260
00:19:17,272 --> 00:19:18,741
Is your first time with a man?

261
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:20,851
You?

262
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:22,912
Uh, n-no.

263
00:19:24,312 --> 00:19:25,238
Really?

264
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:26,684
Really.

265
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:27,562
Huh.

266
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:28,203
Who?

267
00:19:28,228 --> 00:19:29,660
Another player?

268
00:19:32,848 --> 00:19:33,714
Uh, no.

269
00:19:33,835 --> 00:19:35,925
My coach's son
back in Russia.

270
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,555
I like trouble.

271
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,475
Weren't you scared
of getting caught?

272
00:19:44,777 --> 00:19:45,660
Mm, no.

273
00:19:46,338 --> 00:19:48,112
It was nothing serious,
and...

274
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:50,073
we had same secret, so...

275
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,636
it was just...

276
00:19:52,671 --> 00:19:53,651
Curious?

277
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,529
Curious.

278
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,990
And you make me curious.

279
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,122
Do I make you curious?

280
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,666
Obviously.

281
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,504
Did you like sucking my cock?

282
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,381
Wow.

283
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,926
Those English words
just roll off your tongue.

284
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:19,944
Yes?

285
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:21,178
Yes.

286
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,348
You want me to, uh,

287
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,017
lie on the bed
and let you do it some more?

288
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,202
Let me?

289
00:20:28,226 --> 00:20:28,686
Yeah.

290
00:20:38,693 --> 00:20:39,822
Uh, not fair.

291
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,241
Come on, I want to see you.

292
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:43,843
You saw me in the showers.

293
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,411
Yeah, I want more.

294
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,029
OK.

295
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:22,448
Come here.

296
00:21:36,274 --> 00:21:37,002
So...

297
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,298
What do you want to do?

298
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,550
I don't know.

299
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,562
Is this OK?

300
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,384
<i>Da,</i> like that, Hollander.

301
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,729
Fuck, Hollander...

302
00:22:47,776 --> 00:22:48,909
Ah, fuck.

303
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:50,536
Oh.

304
00:22:53,549 --> 00:22:54,999
Not bad for first time.

305
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:57,042
Fuck you, Rozanov.

306
00:22:58,687 --> 00:22:59,655
OK.

307
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:01,630
It was fun.

308
00:23:02,874 --> 00:23:04,008
Are you serious?

309
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,034
What?

310
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,761
What? You need something?

311
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,442
You think I am asshole?

312
00:23:21,448 --> 00:23:22,560
I know you're an asshole.

313
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,235
Oh.

314
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:25,546
 I would not
leave you like that.

315
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,323
No?

316
00:23:27,983 --> 00:23:28,824
No.

317
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:33,329
Let me show you
how to do this, kid.

318
00:23:43,784 --> 00:23:45,020
Holy shit, Rozanov.

319
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,387
Oh, f-fuck...

320
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:55,872
Holy shit, Rozanov,
you better get off.

321
00:23:55,897 --> 00:23:56,936
I'm... I'm getting--
I can't stop.

322
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,647
Oh, fuck!

323
00:23:59,842 --> 00:24:01,081
Rozanov, fuck, fuck, fuck.

324
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,024
Oh, my...

325
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,943
Oh, fuck.

326
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:05,903
Oh my God.

327
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,344
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.
I... I didn't think.

328
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:14,200
What?

329
00:24:14,598 --> 00:24:15,804
That you would come so quick?

330
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,497
Fuck you.

331
00:24:20,772 --> 00:24:22,127
You didn't have to.

332
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,087
I don't mind.

333
00:24:36,317 --> 00:24:37,464
This is, uh...

334
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,470
Yes.

335
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,356

Ilya, you're having
a legendary rookie season.

00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:09,902
Both of you are.

You said you'd hit
50 goals this year.

Are you still thinking
about a 50 goal campaign?

512

Yes.

No chance at all.

to its former glory?

526

And how much of that

527
00:32:45,826 --> 00:32:47,286
do you take on personally?

528
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:50,593

And like all Metros fans,

540
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,428
she wants us to be back
in the playoffs regularly,

541
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,263
and she wants us
to win some cups.

542
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,182
And I want the same thing.

543

I want to be in the playoffs,
